Data Visualization Practice Project

Created by @LucienMens

This project is a refinement of a final exam I had for a programming class.

The program takes in airbnb csv files and processes the hosting info, room info,
the price, and the types of rooms.

I am experimenting with pandas for processing the data and matlab plotting
for displaying the data. Currently, the displays are not interactive, but I
would like to add that in eventually.
